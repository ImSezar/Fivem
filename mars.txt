Introduction
The Memories of Mars Dedicated Server is available via Steam as a Dedicated Server. It can be hosted by players who do not own the game
themselves as well as on dedicated servers which can log into Steam anonymously.
The server is available for Windows and Linux 64 bit versions.
Changelog
Handbook Version Game Version Changes
1.8 1.7.0 For Season 7 we switched our whole
networking backend from SteamSDK to
Photon. This should bring a much more
reliable networking performance and
stability, as well as less bugs and
connection issues with private servers. Due
to this, no port-handling is required
anymore and port-forwarding should also
happen automatically with Photon's NAT
punch-through systems. All now obsolete
parameters have been crossed out in the
sections below.
If for some reason port-forwarding is
required in your setup, follow the guide
here to find out which ports to open for
Photon: https://doc.photonengine.com/en-u
s/realtime/current/connection-and-authentic
ation/tcp-and-udp-port-numbers
As Photon does not support full LAN
servers, we had to remove the button "Join
LAN Server" temporarily from the Main
Menu (it is right now not possible for us to
detect if a local server is running. We are
working on fixing this). You can still find
your local servers in the server browser and
can still run private servers for solo play as
before.
We also introduced a new account system,
which does not rely on SteamIDs anymore.
We now have our own IDs, which can be
used to identify users. Therefore you need
to adjust the "Admins" field in your server
config with your new ID, to be able to use
admin commands and cheats. You can find
your ID in the upper right corner of the main
menu of the game. You can also look up
the ID of other players in the Player List of
the admin panel.
There was also the requirement added, that
the number of building ranks in the
CustomRuleset can not be changed and
must remain at exactly 6 entries. Any other
amount will cause the building rank
configuration to be ignored and defaults will
be used.
1.9 1.7.5 Added flag "PhotonSendDirect" to
DedicatedServerConfig. This variable might
help with lag issues on private servers, but
can cause random disconnects when
connecting over the internet.
1.10 1.7.6 Added flag
"BuildingPreventionSphereRadius" to
BuildingRules to adjust the radius around
each building part in which no other
building can be built.
1.11 1.8.0 We observed network issues with the
previous networking setup and have
worked towards a new system. This brings
back the need for potentially using the
multihome setting and port forwarding. LAN
servers with a private IP address are
currently not possible, we will work on
enabling this feature.
Requirements
The server currently has the following requirements:
1.
2.
a.
3.
4.
5.
6.
CPU The server should have 2 cores/hyperthreads (we made changes
to the stock Unreal Engine 4 that allows the game server to run
multithreaded). The higher the CPU frequency the better.
Memory ~5 GB during normal operation
Disk The server is around 3 GB, but this can grow depending on logs
and the file-based database
Internet-Connection The server needs an ongoing connection to the internet with a a
recommended upspeed of 200kb/s for the best experience in
online play. The ports 7777 and 15000 (configurable) need to be
publicly available.
Installation
Via Steam GUI
You can find the dedicated server in your Steam library as "Memories of Mars - Dedicated Server" in the Tools category if you own Memories
of Mars. You can install it the same way as any other game on Steam.
Via steamcmd
For dedicated servers and platforms without a graphical user interface, you can use Valve's steamcmd tool to install the dedicated server.
You don't have to own Memories of Mars to run servers using this method!
Use the following steps to install the dedicated server via steamcmd
Make sure you are not logged in as root on Linux. The server will not start when root rights are detected.
Download steamcmd (see https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Package_from_repositories)
Probably easiest with something like sudo apt-get install steamcmd
Start steamcmd by typing steamcmd
If it is required that you login (valid until the server has been released), login using login <username>
Unless you want to install to the default directory, choose your install directory by using force_install_dir.
Download the server by issuing app_update 897590
Updating
While Memories of Mars is in Early Access, there will be quite frequent updates. The game client will always be updated to the latest version
via Steam. Most patches during Early access will break compatibility of existing clients with the servers due to major code and content
changes being made, therefore, the dedicated server will have to be updated in order to see servers. If you don't see your dedicated server in
the Steam server browser or in-game, make sure it has the same version as the game client.
If you installed your Dedicated Server via the Steam UI, just wait for the update to be applied.
If you installed via steamcmd, use the same command again to update the server to the latest state:
app_update 897590
Database-breaking patches
We are taking care that no database-breaking changes are put into the server code during a season of Memories of Mars. If, for some
reason, we have to patch the database itself, we will announce this beforehand in patch notes.
To make sure you are up to date with the information about the game and upcoming patches, please follow the news on the Steam page (htt
ps://steamcommunity.com/app/644290) of the game and join our Discord (https://discord.gg/7c6rvnv).
Configuring a server
Your private server is configurable via the file DedicatedServerConfig.cfg that you can find in the main folder where Steam
downloaded the private server to. The following is an example file:
{
 "ServerName": "My Private Server",
 "ServerPassword": "password123",
 "ServerID": "PS_01",
 "MapName": "Main",
 "MaxPlayers": 2,
 "EnablePVP": false,
 "EnablePVPAreas": true,
 "EnableEAC": true,
 "DailyRestartUTCHour": "12",
 "Headless": false,
 "UserWhitelist": "",
 "UserBlacklist": "",
 "Admins": "13374213374213370",
 "PhotonSendDirect": false
 }
The available fields are:
Name Type Example Required Comments
ServerName String My Private Server Yes This is the server name
that you will find the
server under in the
in-game Server Browser
or in the Steam Server
Browser.
ServerPassword String password123 No The password for your
server. If not specified
(or empty string), this will
create a non-password
protected server.
ServerID String MyServer1 Yes By changing this, you
can switch between
different versions of the
database (see section
on database
management).
MapName String Main No This must be set to
Main, so leave the
default.
MaxPlayers Integer 2 No Maximal number of
players for the server.
Default is 64.
EnablePVP Boolean false No If set to true, the server
will be a full PVP server.
If set to false, the server
will be PVE. If not
present, will default to
PVP.
EnablePVPAreas Boolean true No If set to true, this
enables PVP areas
around hotspots with
active FLOPs events. If
not present, defaults to
having PVP areas on
PVE servers. Has no
effect on a PVP server.
1.
2.
EnableEAC Boolean true No If enabled, the server will
be secured with
EasyAntiCheat. If not
present, defaults to
having EasyAntiCheat
on.
DailyRestartUTCHou r
String 12 No This will issue two
restarts of the server:
The indicated hour (
UTC+0) on the
hour.
The indicated hour
(UTC+0) plus 12
hours on the hour.
Times are specified in
the 24 hour system.
Daily restarts are
necessary for server
stability and for
countering floating-point
issues.
Headless Boolean false No If set to true, this will not
open a window with log
outputs. Defaults to true
if not present.
UserWhitelist Array of Strings "12345678910111213|1
3121110987654321"
No A whitelist for the server.
If there is any entry here,
only the Steam IDs thats
are in this list are
allowed to join the
server. This way you can
allow only a couple of
people to join the server.
If there are multiple
entries here the IDs
have to be separated by
using "|". For finding the
Steam ID of another
user, please use the
following guide: https://st
eamcommunity.com/sha
redfiles/filedetails/?id=20
9000244
Since 1.7.0 we have our
own account system.
You don't put Steam IDs
into this field anymore,
but Mars Account IDs,
which you can find in the
upper right corner of the
main menu of the game.
You can also look up the
ID of other players in the
Player List of the admin
panel.
UserBlacklist Array of Strings "12345678910111213|
1
3121110987654321"
No A blacklist for the server.
If a Steam ID is on this
list the person will not be
able to join the server.
This way you can
exclude players from
joining. If there are
multiple entries here the
IDs have to be
separated by using "|".
Since 1.7.0 we have our
own account system.
You don't put Steam IDs
into this field anymore,
but Mars Account IDs,

ID of other players in the
Player List of the admin
panel.
Admins Array of Strings "12345678910111213|
1
3121110987654321"
No A list of Steam IDs
indicating which players
have admin status on
this server. Admins will
be able to open a
special UI and execute a
selection of cheats from
there.
Since 1.7.0 we have our

which you can find in the
upper right corner of the
main menu of the game.
You can also look up the
ID of other players in the
Player List of the admin
panel.
PhotonSendDirect Boolean false No This flag changes the
behaviour of the server
to send data directly to
the clients instead of
routing the traffic
through the Photon
Master Server. If
enabled, latency is
expected to half at the
cost of potential
disconnects when
connecting over the
internet to the server. If
disabled, all traffic is
routed through the
Photon Master Server,
which increases latency,
but can help with
stability.
When playing in LAN it
is recommended to
enable this flag.
Port Number 7777 No The port on which
players connect. Make
sure that this port is
open in order for players
to connect. Defaults to
7777.
SteamQueryPort Number 27015 No Port for Steam. Make
sure it is open. Defaults
to 27015.
BeaconPort Number 15000 No This port is used to
query data from the
server before fully
connecting.
Overriding with Commandline Arguments
The following variables can be overwritten via commandline argument. In the case of "MULTIHOME" there is no applicable variable in the
DedicatedServerConfig, so the variable can only be set via commandline argument.
If no commandline argument is set, the value from the config file is used.
Name Type Usage Comments
Port Number -port=#### (i.e. -port=7778) The port on which players
connect. Make sure that this
port is open in order for players
to connect over the internet.
Defaults to 7777.
SteamQueryPort Number -queryport=#### (i.e.
-queryport=27016)
Port for Steam. Make sure it is
open for the server to appear in
the public server list. Defaults to
27015.
BeaconPort Number -beaconport=12345 The port used for beacons for
initial connection. Make sure
that this port is open in order for
players to connect over the
internet. Defaults to 15000.
MULTIHOME String -MULTIHOME="###.###.###.#
##" (i.e.
-MULTIHOME=192.168.1.26)
Overrides the IP address the
server is running on. The server
will use one of the available IP
addresses but will not ascertain
that this is a publicly reachable
IP address. Used in Multi-IP
environments.
MaxPlayers Number -maxplayers=## (i.e.
-maxplayers=12)
Maximal number of players for
the server. Default is 64.
Custom RuleSet
In our ongoing effort to give players more control over how they play Memories of Mars, we added a second configuration file next to the
DedicatedServerConfig. It's called CustomRuleSet.cfg and contains values that will change gameplay in different ways. If the file is not
present, it should be created automatically as soon as your server starts and will be populated with the default values of your current server
type (PVP/PVE). Of course you can create the file manually as well. Like the DedicatedServerConfig, the CustomRuleSet defines its values
in the Json format and should look like this:
{
 "GameRules":
 {
 "ItemSpawnRate": 1,
 "EnableAISpawning": true,
 "AISpawnRate": 1,
 "AIHealthModifier": 1,
 "AIDamageModifier": 1,
 "EnableMeteorSpawning": true,
 "MeteorSpawnRate": 1,
 },
 "PlayerRules":
 {
 "LogoutWeightThreshold": 1,
 "OxygenDepletionRate": 1,
 "NutritionDepletionRate": 1,
 "ShowPlayerNamesRange": 10000,
 "OnlyShowAlliancePlayerNames": true
 },
 "BuildingRules":
 {
 "EnableBuildingDamage": true,
 "AdditionalBuildingBlocking": false,
 "DecayTimeInHours": 48,
 "ClaimOwnershipCostModifier": 2,
 "BuildingRanks": [
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 50,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 25,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 50,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 2
 },
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 100,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 50,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 75,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 4
 },
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 500,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 100,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 100,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 8
 },
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 1000,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 250,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 150,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 12
 },
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 5000,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 500,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 200,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 16
 },
 {
 "RequiredFlops": 10000,
 "MaxSupportedStructures": 1000,
 "BoundarySphereRadius": 250,
 "ProtectionTimeInDays": 24
 }
 ]
 }
}
Behavior
Depending on which kind of server you start (PVP/PVE) a different predefined RuleSet will be loaded. When starting the server this default
RuleSet will be overridden with the values from your CustomRuleSet file. Unlike the DedicatedServerConfig, this file will update itself when
shutting down the server, which means that changes made during runtime will persist. You can either change rules via Admin-Cheats or you
can change the file directly during runtime. In the latter case, you need to reload the config with the cheat ReloadCustomRuleSet. You can
also save your runtime changes manually with the cheat SaveCustomRuleSet but since the server saves them automatically on shutdown
this is not required (could still be helpful if the server crashes). Cheats that change RuleSet values are prefixed with "SetRule_" and are
continued with the name of the value you want to change.
Note that loading the file while having an invalid Json syntax, won't cause any changes to the currently used ruleset, leaving the previously
set runtime values in place. Also keep in mind that changing the server type from PVP to PVE, or vice versa, will not change any values in
your CustomRuleSet file. You might want to change some values depending on the server type you're using. If you make a switch and just
want the default rules in place, just remove (or rename) the CustomRuleSet file.

Starting the Server
Restarts
The Memories of Mars server needs to be restarted twice daily, this is set up with the option DailyRestartUTCHour. Before the restart, the
server will announce that it will restart in the in-game chat. After the server has been shut down, its process will end.
You are provided with two options for starting the game server:
Without automatic restarting after the twice-daily shutdown
With automatic restarting after the twice-daily shutdown
The server will shut down regardless of which option you choose. We currently don't support disabling this automatic shutdown system. If you
don't need to run the server for 24h a day, you can set the DailyRestartUTCHour to a time outside of your regular playtime to not have
the server shut down during play.
Windows
Either use the Steam UI to start the server, or navigate to the install folder of the game. In both cases, make sure to edit the config file for
setting up the server beforehand.
Without automatic restarts
You can start the server and it will run until it shuts down by starting the game
in the Steam UI with the default start option
directly by starting the file Game\Binaries\Win64\MemoriesOfMarsServer.exe.
With automatic restarts
To run the server with automatic restarts:
in the Steam UI choose the start option Launch Game Server (restart automatically)
Run the batch script Run Server.bat.
Linux
Without automatic restarts
To start the server, start the script MemoriesOfMarsServer.sh in the installation folder of the game.
With automatic restarts
To start the server with automatic restarts, start the script RunServer.sh in the installation folder of the game. You might consider running
this in the background or in a screen so it persists your login session.
LAN servers, Firewall issues
Port-Forwarding
A game server needs to ports to be open on UDP and TCP. Both ports are specified in the DedicatedServerConfig.cfg and can be changed
to whatever ports you want (as long as they are different from each other). A public server needs to have both ports open. Depending on
your setup of the host machine (the one running the server), you may need to open the ports in a firewall and in the internet router. Look up
your router model on this website on how to do that: https://portforward.com/
LAN server
With version 1.8.0 LAN servers will not work. We will work towards enabling them again.
Connecting to a private server
In-game browser
Choose either ALL or PRIVATE in the filter settings of the in-game server browser and connect to your server.
Steam server browser
You can join a server from the Steam server browser.
Database maintenance
The files for the database will be stored in the following folder: Game/Saved/DB/{ServerID}/{SeasonID}.
You can create an easy backup of your files by copying everthing inside this folder and paste it elsewhere.
Once the game reaches a new season the database folder will create a new database inside a new season folder. The data from the
previous season is still stored, but will not be used for the new season. The reason for that is, that we can not guarantee that the way the
data is stored will not change between seasons. So you will start with a clean database in a new season, just like on the public servers.

If you are still willing to try to save your old data somehow you can try to manually copy the data over from the previous season. This might or
might not work, depending on the changes made. So expect your game to cause some problems afterwards. If you can't get the game to run
anymore after this just delete all the files you put in there and make sure you have a clean database.
NOTE: There will be no support by us for manually moving old databases to your newer server in case of database-breaking changes
between seasons.
Reporting Errors
In case you encounter an error with the server, please inform us about it by using the game's support page at https://fs30.formsite.com/505g
ames/mars/index.html
Please attach any information that can help us track down the error. Especially server logs and crash dumps are interesting for us. This
information can be found in:
Windows
The subfolder Game\Saved contains the data written by the servers. Especially the Game.log in the subfolder Game\Saved\Logs is good
for us, as well as the contents of the latest crash report in a subfolder of Game\Saved\Crashes.
Linux
The subfolder Game/Saved contains the data written by the servers. Especially the Game.log in the subfolder Game\Saved\Logs is good
for us. Additionally, the server creates a core dump, which you will find in the root folder of the game server as a file starting with core.
Admin Tools
Admins on a Dedicated Server are able to open an AdminTools window with F8. The key to show the window can be changed in the Input
Settings (in case F8 doesn't work make sure it's bound there). From here you have the option to execute a selection of cheats to author your
server.
Player List
The Player List shows all players that are currently connected to your server. At the bottom you have buttons to kick a selected player,
teleport to them or teleport them to your current location.
Cheat List
The Cheat List contains a selection of cheats you are allowed to execute as admin. Here you can find the usual cheats like toggling
GodMode, spawning AIs or refill your HP and survival stats. To execute a cheat select it from the list and click the Execute Button at the
bottom.
There's also a cheat for changing the Server Password. Note that executing this cheat will not change the password in the
DedicatedServerConfig and therefore will only be temporary. Also changing from no password to having a password or vice versa will not be
reflected at runtime. You would need to restart your server and change the password in your DedicatedServerConfig to accomplish that.
Items
The Item List contains all items sorted by category. Here you cheat items into your inventory by selecting the item and clicking the Execute
Button at the bottom. There's also a number field where you can enter the amount of items you want to receive.
To make it easier to find the items you desire, we added a search bar as well as the option to mark items as favourites which will then appear
inside the Favourites category at the very top.
PDA Map
Admins also have the option to teleport themselves to an arbitrary location on the map. To do that, just open the map in your PDA, right-click
on the location you want to teleport to and select the "CHEAT: Teleport here" option from the context menu.
Known Issues and Troubleshooting
My friends can't see my server in the server list
Please make sure you followed all instructions above, especially the one about port forwarding and firewalls. Make sure your firewall is open
for the two ports in the DedicatedServerConfig for both UDP and TCP and that your router is forwarding them to you as well. 90% of all
issues with the server come down to closed ports, so check it thoroughly. Also make sure to only run one instance per server on each
installation and port configuration. If you run two servers simultaneously on the same configuration they might interfere with each other and
none of them might work.
You can run multiple servers per computer, but have to do that via commandline overrides of ports. That is for advanced users only! The only
thing necessary to run multiple servers is to download the server twice and give them different names. No need to change ports anymore!
(1.7.0)
What about all those warnings/errors in the log! What am I doing wrong?
Nothing actually. Servers will throw a lot of warnings right now, but you can safely ignore them at this moment. They are not for you to fix, but
us .
